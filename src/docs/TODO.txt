To Do List


0.2 RELEASE
===========

See
<http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ZeroPointTwoCosmoPlanning>
for current development plan. Additional tasks:

WebDAV:
 * honor Content-Type header when importing a resource and when
   deciding if a resource is a calendar resource
 * honor Content-Language header when importing a resource, saving it
   as the dav content language property
 * figure out why creationdate property is undefined for collections
 * figure out why creationdate property is in iso8861 format

CalDAV:
 * use the dav content language property to set xml:lang when
   PROPFINDing the caldav calendar-description property
 * honor Content-Language header when PROPPATCHing
   the caldav calendar-description property

UI:
 * final copy and format for mail messages


LATER RELEASES
==============

See "Deferred Features" section of the 0.2 Spec at
<http://svn.osafoundation.org/server/cosmo/trunk/src/docs/spec/cosmo-0.2-spec.html>

 * support OPTIONS and PROPFIND requests for principal URLs
 * account activation
    o system generates email at signup containing activation url; user
      must click the url to confirm his address and activation his
      account before he can use the account
    o admin can auto-confirm users
 * move new user form to its own page
 * home directory browser
 * honor HTTP Accept header in case the client prefers text/html over
   text/calendar for calendar collections
 * jsp precompilation
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * look into litmus failures
 * figure out how to make Acegi Security not cache the token if it
   doesn't authenticate or if access is denied. caching the token
   causes problems for clients that send the session cookie to the
   server (cadaver, browsers, etc.) - low priority since chandler does
   not deal with the session cookie
 * consider adding cosmo product id and version to server header
