0.2 RELEASE
===========

See
<http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ZeroPointTwoCosmoPlanning>
for current development plan. Additional tasks:

 * ticket method tests

 * precompile jsps for distribution
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * final copy and format for mail messages
 * find a better way to specify configuration items than using j2ee
   environment entries
 * look into litmus failures
 * potentially find a server- or webapp-startup-time equivalent for
   repo init that can use existing security mechanisms rather than
   relying on repository_init.xml which has to be kept in sync with
   the test and production repository.xml files
