0.2 RELEASE
===========

See
<http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ZeroPointTwoCosmoPlanning>
for current development plan. Additional tasks:

WebDAV:
 * extend PROPPATCH implementation to store arbitrary dead properties
   (upcoming jackrabbit feature will register new namespaces as they
   are encountered)
 * filter jcr: properties out of PROPFIND
 * support PROPPATCH for DAV:displayname by converting it to the jcr
   property dav:displayname

CalDAV:
 * calendar description: include CALDAV:calendar-description property
   for homedirs and calendar collections (4.4.1)
 * calendar component restrictions: include
   CALDAV:calendar-component-restriction-set protected property for
   calendar collections specifying VEVENT only (4.4.2)
 * calendar restrictions: include CALDAV:calendar-restrictions
   protected property for calendar collections specifying
   calendar-data with content-type "text/calendar" and version "2.0"
   (4.4.3)
 * PUT: store event alarms and timezones
 * PUT: ensure that "If-None-Match: *" and "If-Match: <etag>" request
   headers are honored, and return ETag response header (4.6.2)
 * PUT: honor preconditions - uid already, exists, invalid calendar
   resource (4.6.2)

Tickets:
 * consider splitting security config into completely separate ones
   for ui and dav
 * ticket method tests

General:
 * precompile jsps for distribution
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * final copy and format for mail messages
 * find a better way to specify configuration items than using j2ee
   environment entries
 * look into litmus failures
 * potentially find a server- or webapp-startup-time equivalent for
   repo init that can use existing security mechanisms rather than
   relying on repository_init.xml which has to be kept in sync with
   the test and production repository.xml files
 * figure out how to make Acegi Security not cache the token if it
   doesn't authenticate or if access is denied. caching the token
   causes problems for clients that send the session cookie to the
   server (cadaver, browsers, etc.) - low priority since chandler does
   not deal with the session cookie
 * figure out why cadaver tacks on a / to the query string when we
   try to open a url with a ticket in the query string
