                               Build Instructions


SETUP
=====

To set up your environment for Cosmo development, perform the
following steps:


(1) If your operating system does not already provide it, download and
    install a Java Runtime Environment (version 1.4 or later)

    * Download a JRE release from

        http://java.sun.com/j2se/

    * Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

    * Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the
      directory into which you installed the JDK release.

(2) If your operating system does not already it, download and 
    install the Maven build tool (version 1.0 or later, but NOT 2.0)

    * Download a Maven release from:

        http://maven.apache.org/

    * Install Maven according to the instructions included with the
      release.

    * Set an environment variable MAVEN_HOME to the pathname of the
      Maven installation directory.

    * Add $MAVEN_HOME/bin to your PATH.


SOURCE CODE
===========

Find instructions for accessing the OSAF CVS repository here (search
for "CVS Access"):

    http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/CosmoTempHome

The Cosmo module is "cosmo" (this is a change from Cosmo 0.1).


BUILD
=====

The project descriptor is project.xml in the root directory of the
module. Additional build instructions are found in maven.xml. Default
build properties are set in project.properties. You can customize your
build by providing a build.properties file in the same directory (see
CUSTOMIZE below).

The most commonly-used goals are:

  build                compile and test all source code
  clean                remove all compiled source code and helper files
  test                 run all tests
  dist                 package the distribution
  dist-clean           remove the distribution package and helper files

All generated files are placed into the target/ subdirectory.


TEST
====

There aren't too many tests yet, but those that exist can be run with
'maven test'. Before doing so, however, you will need to initialize the
test database with 'maven test-dbsetup'. Do these as separate maven calls,
however, because otherwise the forked JUnit JVM will not have access
to the hsqldb embedded within the original Maven process.

If you want to build or package cosmo without running the tests (often
useful when making small incremental changes to the user interface),
you can run 'maven -Dmaven.test.skip=true build' (or whichever goal).

JUnit writes detailed test output in XML format to
target/test-reports/. This, and the brief console output it generates
should be more than enough to debug test failures.


RUN
===

'maven dist' creates a dist/ subdirectory containing an unpacked
distribution (cosmo-x.x/). You can run Cosmo right out of this
directory with 'dist/cosmo-x.x/bin/cosmoctl start'. See INSTALL.txt
for more details on running Cosmo.


RELEASE
=======

'maven dist-release' creates a packaged distribution of the Tomcat
bundle at dist/cosmo-x.x.tar.gz. A separate unbundled WAR file will
come in a future version.


CUSTOMIZE
=========

All of the following customizations are placed in build.properties,
overriding the properties set in build.properties.

Some common development customizations:

    maven.compile.debug=on
    maven.compile.deprecation=on
    maven.compile.optimize=off
    cosmo.webapp.reloadable=true
    cosmo.serverAdmin=<me@my.host>

Maven downloads a copy of Tomcat to package the bundled
distribution. You can override the following properties to specify
your favorite mirror and/or choose a different version of Tomcat (but
beware the latter - see the compatibility notes in README.txt):

    ext.tomcat.package=jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28
    ext.tomcat.url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/apache/jakarta/tomcat-5/v5.0.28/bin/${ext.tomcat.package}.tar.gz
