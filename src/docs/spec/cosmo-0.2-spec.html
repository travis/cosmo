<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 has four primary
goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Support for Chandler 0.6
sharing features</li>
  <li>An interface for end users
to sign up for and manage their own accounts</li>
  <li>Basic standards-based
interoperability with calendar clients other than Chandler</li>
  <li>Windows platform support</li>
  <li>Special support for Apple
iCal so that their calendar sharing format (which is iCalendar, but not
CalDAV) can be translated from (and possibly to) the format used by
CalDAV/Chandler.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
  <dt>Brian Moseley</dt>
  <dd>Spec owner, development lead<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The initial version of Cosmo
focused on securely providing basic sharing support for multiple users
in a single repository. Sharing in Cosmo 0.1 is performed solely by
WebDAV; there are no calendar-specific features. A user can synchronize
a collection across multiple instances of Chandler by
storing opaque data files in the user's Cosmo home directory. However,
Cosmo 0.1 does not provide a mechanism for allowing a second user to
view or edit the collection.</p>
<p>In Cosmo 0.1, an administrator
has to log into the "admin console" web user interface to provision an
account for an end user and then email or otherwise communicate the
account details to the user. This is a significant barrier to usage of
Chandler's sharing and synchronization features, especially considering
that OSAF (and perhaps other organizations) will in the future host a
public Cosmo server for users who are not part of a workgroup with a
dedicated Cosmo installation and administrator.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals for
the eventual Cosmo 1.0 is interoperability with standards-based
calendar clients via CalDAV. A staged approach toward CalDAV
implementation allows the realization of primary interoperability use
cases in early Cosmo and Chandler versions. Furthermore, Cosmo should
make special allowance for Apple's iCal, which uses the "first
generation"
technique
of publishing and subscribing to monolithic iCalendar resources
(events, timezones, and calendar bundled into a single WebDAV resource)
rather than the single-iCalendar-object-per-resource approach of CalDAV.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Chandler user attempts to
share his calendar for the first
time. Lacking a WebDAV account, he is given a link to a Cosmo web page
where he can sign up for an account.</li>
  <li>A user is entering WebDAV
information for an existing Cosmo
account into a Chandler installation on a second computer, but he has
forgotten his username.</li>
  <li>A user is entering WebDAV
information for an existing Cosmo
account into a Chandler installation on a second computer, but he has
forgotten his password.</li>
  <li>A user changes his username,
email address, and/or password via a
Cosmo web page.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user shares a
calendar with a set of friends who also
use Chandler. Some of the friends are allowed to update the calendar,
while the others can only view the calendar.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user shares a
calendar with a friend who subscribes to
it with iCal.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user subscribes
to a calendar published by a friend
who uses iCal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Tickets (Access control)</h3>
<p>Cosmo must accept a ticket
specified in the URL of a WebDAV resource
in preference to other authentication schemes and access control
procedures (e.g. Basic authentication, ACL-based authorization) as
per <em>Ticket-Based Access
Control Extension
to WebDAV</em> (see link at bottom).
In addition, must be able to accept ticket-creation requests.</p>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will not support any
mechanisms for controlling access to
a user's home directory by another user other than tickets. A future
version will allow
a user to assign permissions on his home directory to other users
(probably only on the same server) via WebDAV ACL and a web user
interface.</p>
<h3>iCalendar (RFC2445) and CalDAV
Interoperability</h3>
<p>Cosmo must be able to store
iCalendar calendar and event objects in
its repository in such a way as to facilitate CalDAV queries, even
though those queries are not supported by this version of Cosmo.
Addressing this requirement eliminates a significant risk early in
Cosmo's development (that of not knowing how much effort it will take
to make the repository aware of calendar content) and reduces the
amount of data migration necessary when upgrading to future versions.</p>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 must validate new or
updated event resources for correct syntax and semantics on each PUT
request. GET and DELETE will be handled normally for event resources.</p>
<p>Cosmo will support CalDAV's
MKCALENDAR request. Cosmo will advertise support for CalDAV even though
not all of CalDAV will be interoperable in 0.2.</p>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will support PROPFIND
on calendar collections, listing individual event resources, but not
the special CalDAV REPORTs. </p>
<h3>Apple's iCal Interoperability</h3>
<p>Basic client/server
interoperability with Apple's iCal client will be supported for Cosmo
0.2. Apple's iCal works with calendar data at a granularity of one file
per calendar and expects to be able to GET, PUT and DELETE
whole-calendar iCalendar resources (iCal does not understand CalDAV
collections or single-event resources). Cosmo will translate to and
from this format for both read and write operations as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>iCal expects to be able to
use a single resource with a URL ending in .ics and a certain MIME type
(text/calendar). Cosmo will handle these URLs, managing a dynamic
resource that will appear alongside a CalDAV calendar collection URL,
in the same parent collection. </li>
  <li>A GET request to the URL
used by iCAL will be handled by the Cosmo server bundling the calendar
data into a single .ics file for the response.</li>
  <li>A DELETE request will remove
the calendar collection as well as the monolithic calendar resource.</li>
  <li>A PUT request will be
interpreted and individual event resources in the calendar collection
will be added, overwritten or deleted as appropriate (not overwritten
wholesale). More on this in protocol interactions section.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Do we say something about Cosmo's "native" format? -->
<h3>Chandler share data</h3>
<p>Cosmo must allow Chandler to
store arbitrary data files within a calendar collection. When sharing
an ItemCollection, Chandler will create a calendar collection in the
user's home directory to contain iCalendar resources and beneath that a
regular collection to contain the shared ContentItems in Chandler's
internal format. Cosmo does not have to understand the names or formats
of any of the resources within the subcollection. The subcollection
itself does not have to follow any particular naming policy; because
CalDAV specifies that calendar collections may not contain other
calendar collections, Cosmo can ignore any subcollections of a calendar
collection when generating an iCalendar view of a calendar collection.</p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The CalDAV server timezone
collection functionality is being removed from CalDAV in draft version
06 therefore Cosmo will not support it.</li>
  <li>Tickets do not necessarily
represent unique individuals; a ticket can be given to and used by
multiple persons.</li>
  <li>Tickets will not be used in
the timeframe of Cosmo 0.2 to access the web user interface.</li>
  <li>We are making certain
assumptions about Apple's iCal client functionality that will need to
be confirmed through interoperability testing or other testing. If our
assumptions turn out to be incorrect we'll update the design decisions
described here.</li>
  <li>Chandler 0.6 schedule
currently includes work for Chandler to support the iCalendar format
for event resources and to use it to create resources. This work is
required in order to interoperate with Apple iCal and with Cosmo's
support for iCal. Morgen confirmed that this is on his 0.6 schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h3>High-level Decisions</h3>
<p>Chandler 0.6 will provide a
link to a Cosmo account signup page
whenever a user is prompted to enter WebDAV account information. A
future version will support a Cosmo API for automated account creation.</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Calendar collection</dt>
  <dd>A WebDAV collection that
advertises to clients that it may
contain calendar resources; may contain non-calendar resources and
collections but may not contain calendar collections.</dd>
  <dt>ContentItem</dt>
  <dd>A piece of information
stored by Chandler such as a calendar,
event, or email message; not shareable itself, only as part of an
ItemCollection</dd>
  <dt>Individual iCalendar resource</dt>
  <dd>An HTTP resource containing
an iCalendar representation of a
single calendar object (calendar, event, or timezone)</dd>
  <dt>ItemCollection</dt>
  <dd>A group of Chandler
ContentItems that can be shared between
Chandler users; the fundamental unit of sharing for Chandler</dd>
  <dt>Monolithic iCalendar resource</dt>
  <dd>An HTTP resource containing
an iCalendar representation of a
calendar and its constituent events and timezones</dd>
  <dt>WebDAV collection</dt>
  <dd>A resource on a WebDAV

roughly equivalent to a directory or folder in a file system</dd>
</dl>
<h2>User Interface / Interaction</h2>
<h3>Account Signup</h3>
<p>This page has a form with these
fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>username (required, must be
unique, 3-32 chars long, legal chars
are letters, numbers, underscores, spaces, periods, hyphens,
apostrophes)</li>
  <li>email address (required,
must be unique,
1-32 chars long)</li>
  <li>password (required, 5-16
chars long)</li>
  <li>password confirmation
(required, must match password)</li>
  <li>Full name (required, 1-100
chars long)</li>
</ul>
<p>The user registration form
captures full name so that later on we can
use this information in places like access logs, interfaces to browse
peoples' calendars, etc. If we don't capture full name now then there
will be accounts
created on test and trial servers which don't have this information.
Asking
for full name is appropriate for the dogfood usage expected in 0.2
timeframe although later in hosting situations we might find some
resistance from users who don't want to reveal full names.</p>
<p>The email address is required
to be unique so that we can look up accounts even when login IDs are
forgotten. It is easier to change our minds later and relax this
requirement than it is to go the other way.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the input.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If validation fails, the
form is redisplayed including a message
for each error</li>
  <li>Otherwise the server creates
the account, sends a confirmation
email to the specified address, logs in the user and displays the
Welcome Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Account Management</h3>
<p>This page has a form with the
same fields as on the Account Signup
page. The validation rules are slightly different in that the password
and confirmation are not required if the password is not being changed
(but both are required if the password is being changed).</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the input.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If validation fails, the
form is redisplayed including a message
for each error.</li>
  <li>Otherwise the server updates
the account and redisplays the
Account Management Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forgotten Username or password</h3>
<p>This <em>popup</em>
has a form containing a single email address field.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the given address.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an account does not exist
with the address, the form is
redisplayed including an error message.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the server sends
an email to the address containing
the username of the associated account and redisplays the Login Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forgotten Password</h3>
<p>This <em>popup</em>
has a form containing
a single username field.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the given username.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an account does not exist
with the username, the form is
redisplayed including an error message.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the server sends
an email containing the password of the associated account to the
account's address and redisplays the Login Page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protocol Interactions</h2>
<h3>Tickets</h3>
<p>Cosmo will implement the
MKTICKET
and DELTICKET methods defined in <em>Ticket-Based
Access Control Extension
to WebDAV</em> (see link at bottom). The response to a MKTICKET request
will include only the tickets owned by the user sending the request
(including the one just created). Cosmo will fully support ticket
timeouts. Cosmo will not support PROPFIND requests for the
ticketdiscovery property.</p>
<h4>Deviations from Spec</h4>
<p>The Xythos ticket implementation differs from the specification in
numerous ways. In order to promote interoperability, Cosmo will align
with the Xythos implementation as much as possible, looking forward to
a new version of the spec in the near future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visit limits are not supported (and will likely be removed from
future versions of the spec). Cosmo will always return the value&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">infinity</span> for the <code>visits</code>
element.<span style="font-family: monospace;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><code /></span></span></span></li>
  <li>The custom XML namespace&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">http://www.xythos.com/namespaces/StorageServer</span>
is used for the <code>ticketdiscovery</code>, <code>ticketinfo</code>,
    <code>id</code> and <code>timeout</code> elements.</li>
  <li>Valid values for the <code>timeout</code> element are&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">infinity</span> for tickets that never
time out and strings of the form&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Seconds-xxxx</span>
where&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">xxxx</span> is the
lifetime of the ticket in seconds.</li>
  <li>If different tickets are included in the request headers and URL,
the ticket in the URL is used.</li>
  <li>If a DELTICKET request is received for a resource or ticket on
which the requesting principal does not have access privileges, Cosmo
returns a 403 (Forbidden) response. Example: user A owns resource X and
creates ticket 123 on it. user B does not have privileges on resource X
but attempts to delete the ticket.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CalDAV</h3>
<p>Cosmo will implement
individually-addressable calendar objects and the MKCALENDAR method as
per <em>Calendaring Extensions to
WebDAV (CalDAV)</em> (see link at
bottom).</p>
<h3>iCal's usage</h3>
<p>Although iCal uses normal HTTP
and WebDAV requests (PUT, GET in particular), its data model is
inconsistent with that of CalDAV and that used by Chandler. Thus, Cosmo
will require special handling of certain requests from iCal.</p>
<p>Handling iCal GET requests is
expected to be rather straightforward. Cosmo will take all the event
resources in the calendar collection (the one with the same base name
as the URL used by iCal) and wrap those events up into one iCalendar
file with START:VCALENDAR and END:VCALENDAR around it. For 0.2, where
performance isn't likely to be a problem, Cosmo can concatenate event
data either in memory or while streaming over the wire. </p>
<p>Handling iCal PUT requests
requires a little more care.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parse the entire iCalendar
file and reject the PUT request if it can't be parsed.</li>
  <li>Compare the list of events
from iCal to the list of events in the calendar collection. If the
calendar collection doesn't yet exist, create it and all the event
resources inside it. If it does already exist, figure out which events
are new in the iCal data and which resources are absent in the iCal
data (deleted).</li>
  <li>For each event that is new
in the iCal data, create a new event resource in the calendar
collection, preserving all the data provided.</li>
  <li>For each event that is
absent in the iCal data, delete the event resource in the calendar
collection.</li>
  <li>For events that appear in
both the iCal data and the existing calendar collection, determine if
the event data is identical or has been changed. See note.</li>
  <li>For events that have not
been changed, leave the event resource untouched so that the ETag
doesn't change and Chandler synchronization works better.</li>
  <li>For events that have
changed, update the event resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: One concern with this
plan is what to do if Apple iCal alters event data routinely. For
example, Chandler wishes to preserve timezone information for each
event but it's conceivable that iCal might translate all events to UTC
and lose that information. If we run into any of these kinds of issues
we may or may not be able to deal with it easily.</p>
<h2>Special Considerations</h2>
<h3>QA / Test</h3>
<p>Cosmo will provide a full suite
of unit and integration tests for
every subsystem so that QA can focus on functional and security
testing. This should involve verifying the behaviors described in the
"User Interface/Interaction" section above and attempting to compromise
the system (see "Security" below).</p>
<p>As we do not have any explicit
performance or scalability goals at
this time, tests in those areas should probably be limited to
establishing a baseline which can be used to compare the qualities of
successive versions.</p>
<h3>API / Developer Platform</h3>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will not support any
external APIs.<br />
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Historically many web sites and
applications have been susceptible
to URL hacking, SQL injection, cross site scripting, and similar
attacks. A professional web application in 2005 has no excuse for these
sorts of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Other security concerns include
verifying that a generated ticket
has exactly the requested set of permissions (read or read/write) on
the associated resource only (the ticket should not allow access to any
other resource) and assuring that the tickets cannot be forged or
spoofed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the ticket scheme
is inherently insecure, even more so
due to Chandler 0.6's policy of using non-expiring, infinite-use
tickets. This means that a ticket-bearing URL placed on a web page
could be indexed by Google, for instance, making the ticketed resource
available to the world at large. The only way to guarantee the security
of a ticket in a sharing notification is by exchanging the URL in a
fully encrypted fashion (via S/MIME, for example) and not exposing it
to unauthorized or untrusted clients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chandler 0.5 does
not support WebDAV over SSL, so
tickets are exposed as soon as they are generated by the server and
sent to the client. Chandler 0.6, however, will support WebDAV over
SSL.</p>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will only support
Basic authentication and ticket access control. A
future version will add Digest support in preference to Basic.</p>
<h3>Internationalization /
Localization</h3>
<p>JSTL and Java message resource
bundles will be used to provide an
internationalized web user interface. The web interface will be
designed to be as locale-independent as possible (avoiding intermixing
widgets and text, using coarse-grained message resources, etc). The
only shipped localization will be US English, but we will obviously
accept localizations in this area.</p>
<p>Exceptions and other messages
written to the Cosmo logs will be in
US English. There are no plans to provide localized log messages in
future versions of Cosmo, although we are open to debate on this issue.</p>
<p>Questions of
internationalization of the data stored in the Cosmo
repository are deferred to a later version.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Not enough is known about web
user interface accessibility at this
time. It is anticipated that future versions of Cosmo will provide
keyboard shortcuts and utilize other XHTML accessibility mechanisms as
appropriate. Community discussions on this topic are welcomed.</p>
<h3>Build / Install</h3>
<p>Cosmo's build system will be
migrated from Ant to Maven, and the source code will be moved from CVS
to Subversion.</p>
