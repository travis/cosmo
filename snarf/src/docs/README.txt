OSAF Server Bundle


WHAT IS THE SERVER BUNDLE?
==========================

The OSAF Sever Bundle integrates the Cosmo and Scooby calendar
application and server with the Tomcat servlet container and the
Derby embedded database to provide an integrated, easy-to-run
calendar server.  The server bundle also includes configuration
options and the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver to run Cosmo
against a MySQL 5 database server.
