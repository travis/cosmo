Client Development - Tickets


Overview
========

"Ticket-Based Access Control Extension to WebDAV" [1] defines
extensions to WebDAV for transmitting a token or "ticket" in the
request to assign access privileges to a user otherwise unknown to the
WebDAV server.

Cosmo's ticket support allows Chandler to provide a universal sharing
feature. A Chandler user with a Cosmo account can share a calendar to
the server and generate read-only and/or read-write tickets for the
calendar. The user can then communicate the calendar's URL and a
ticket to another person, who can then subscribe to the calendar even
if he does not have an account on the Cosmo server. Cosmo tickets are
not specific to Chandler; other clients can take advantage of Cosmo
tickets to implement similar functionality.


Ticket Scope and Privileges
===========================

Tickets are inherited from ancestor resources. If a ticket is created
on a resource, that ticket's id may be presented for that resource or
any of its descendents to gain access as per the ticket's privileges.

  Ex: the ticket 123 created on /home/bcm/MyCalendar/ is also honored
      for /home/bcm/MyCalendar/deadbeef.ics and for
      /home/bcm/MyCalendar/.chandler/sharing.ics. It is not honored
      for /home/bcm/ or /home/bcm/arbitrary_file.txt.

The ticket specification defines two possible ticket privileges,
"read" and "write". The read privilege corresponds to the OPTIONS,
GET, HEAD and PROPFIND methods, and the write privilege allows the
POST, PUT, DELETE, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK,
MKCALENDAR, MKTICKET and DELTICKET methods.


Request Methods
===============

Cosmo implements the MKTICKET and DELTICKET methods defined in the
ticket spec and makes the ticketdiscovery property available via
PROPFIND (this property is protected).

Clients may as usual use an OPTIONS request to discover whether or not
MKTICKET and DELTICKET are supported methods for a particular Cosmo
URI.

Due to interoperability concerns and the age of the specification, the
XML content for a MKTICKET request looks slightly different than
what's in the specification (see "Deviations from Spec" below for
details).

The Cosmo version of the example from section 2.3 of the spec is:

  >>Request
  MKTICKET /home/bcm/MyCalendar HTTP/1.1
  Host: cosmo.osafoundation.org
  Content-length: xxx
  Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
  Authorization: Basic dGVzdHVzZXI6dGVzdHVzZXI=

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
  <D:prop xmlns:D="DAV:"
          xmlns:ticket="http://www.xythos.com/namespaces/StorageServer">
    <ticket:ticketinfo>
      <D:privilege><D:read/></D:privilege> 
      <ticket:timeout>Second-3600</ticket:timeout> 
    </ticket:ticketinfo>
  </D:prop>

  >>Response
  HTTP/1.0 200 OK
  Ticket: 266dxwmag0
  Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
  Content-Length: xxx

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <D:prop xmlns:D="DAV:"
          xmlns:ticket="http://www.xythos.com/namespaces/StorageServer">
    <ticket:ticketdiscovery>
      <ticket:ticketinfo>
        <ticket:id>266dxwmag0</ticket:id>
        <D:owner>
          <D:href>http://localhost:8080/principal/bcm</D:href>
        </D:owner>
        <ticket:timeout>Second-3600</ticket:timeout>
        <ticket:visits>infinity</ticket:visits>
        <D:privilege>
          <D:read />
        </D:privilege>
      </ticket:ticketinfo>
    </ticket:ticketdiscovery>
  </D:prop>


Deviations from Spec
====================

The Xythos ticket implementation differs from the specification in
numerous ways. In order to promote interoperability, Cosmo aligns with
Xythos as much as possible. There were also a few holes in the
spec. The complete list of spec differences is as follows:

  (1) Visit limits are not supported. Regardless of what is requested,
      Cosmo always returns a value of infinity. Xythos behaves the
      same way, and visit limits will likely be removed from future
      versions of the spec.

  (2) The custom XML namespace
      "http://www.xythos.com/namespaces/StorageServer" is used for XML
      elements defined by the spec (ticketdiscovery, ticketinfo, id
      and timeout).

  (3) The MKTICKET request content is wrapped in a DAV:prop element.

  (4) If different ticket ids are included in the request headers and
      URL, the id in the URL is used (the one from the Ticket header
      is ignored, even if the ticket identified by the URL is not
      found by the server).

  (5) If a DELTICKET request is received for a resource on which the
      requesting user does not have appropriate access privileges,
      Cosmo returns a 403 (Forbidden) response. Example: User A owns
      resource X and creates ticket 123 on it. User B does not have
      privileges on resource X but attempts to delete the ticket.

  (6) Similarly, only the owner of a ticket (the user who created
      it via MKTICKET) or a user with root privileges can delete it
      with DELTICKET.


Unimplemented
=============

The following items from the ticket spec are not yet implemented:

  (1) Support the OPTIONS and PROPFIND methods for principal URLs
      (those indicated by the DAV:owner property of a
      ticket:ticketinfo XML element) (section 5.1)
